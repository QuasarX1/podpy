This repository contains the an implentation of the pixel optical depth method as described in Turner et al. 2014, MNRAS, 445, 794, which builds upon the description in Aguirre et al. 2002, ApJ, 576, 1. If you use the code, please cite these two works, which can be found here:

The example QSO spectrum of J010311+131617 was obtained from the Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorbers toward QSOs (KODIAQ; O'Meara et al. 2015, AJ, 150, 111; Lehner et al. 2014, ApJ 788, 119), which was funded through NASA ADAP grant NNX10AE84G. This research has made use of the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA), which is operated by the W. M. Keck Observatory and the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI), under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. We also acknowledge the PI of the dataset, C.Steidel.
